- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Erik, I'm a recent Cybersecurity graduate looking to change career fields after 10 years of active duty service and 8 years spent as a contractor. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in investigating Cybersecurity news to learn about how cybersecurity attacks were successful, that way we can learn from what caused them to be effective and try to stop those routes in the future.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and refining my coding skills within Python, Java, and PowerShell through the utilization of small projects and challenges.
- âš¡ I am also exploring opportunities to break into the IT field ranging from Network Admin to Cybersecurity Analyst.
